# Human Resource Analytics & ML Project 
This project utilizes a human resources dataset to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various employee-related metrics. By applying data science techniques, we explore key trends, identify areas for improvement and gain valuable insights into the company's workforce.

## 📝 Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on a fictitious company's [HR dataset (v14)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). The dataset includes information such as:
- Personal details: Names, DOBs, gender, marital status
- Employment details: Hire date, termination reason, department, position title, salary, manager name and employment status
- Performance metrics: Performance score, most recent performance review date, absences and engagement score

## 🔍 Project Workflow
All analysis is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook, covering:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data inspection, missing value checks, distributions, and summary statistics
2. Business Insights: Salary trends, retention vs. termination patterns, department-wise comparisons, manager team sizes, engagement analysis
3. Data Visualization: Histograms, barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and time-based trends
4. PCA & Clustering: Dimensionality reduction, explained variance plots, 2D visualizations and basic clustering for deeper insights

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
  
## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Kimaiyoo/hr_analytics.git
cd hr_analytics
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. Open Jupyter Notebook / Colab and run the notebooks step by step.


## 📌 Notes
The dataset is synthetic and designed for educational use.
