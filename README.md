# Human Resource Analytics & ML Project 
This project utilizes a human resources dataset to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various employee-related metrics. By applying data science techniques, we explore key trends, identify areas for improvement and gain valuable insights into the company's workforce.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
All analysis is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook, covering:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data inspection, missing value checks, distributions, and summary statistics
2. Business Insights: Salary trends, retention vs. termination patterns, department-wise comparisons, manager team sizes, engagement analysis
3. Data Visualization: Histograms, barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and time-based trends
4. PCA & Clustering: Dimensionality reduction, explained variance plots, 2D visualizations and basic clustering for deeper insights

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
